### Project description✍️
This project is about building an Online Interviews Platform where students or job seekers can practice and learn how to give interviews. The platform allows users to prepare for interview sessions for any role in any company.
Users can connect with industry professionals, participate in mock interview sessions, and receive valuable tips, advice, and feedback to improve their interview skills. Each interview session with a professional requires the candidate to pay a certain amount. This platform aims to help candidates gain confidence, improve their interview performance, and increase their chances of landing their desired job.
